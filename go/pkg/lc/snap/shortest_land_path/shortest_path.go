package shortest_land_path

/*
You are given a n x n array of integers where each position contains a 1 or 0.
1 represents land and 0 represents water.
You walk from the top of the input to the bottom using the shortest land path.
You can move up, down, left or right (no diagonal movements).
Modify the array so that every cell not on the shortest land path is water.
