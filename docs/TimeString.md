# Time String

## Rules

Implement the `TimeStringAggregator` interface. The `PrintSum` method takes a list of strings (minutes and seconds) and returns
the sum of the times (hours, minutes, and seconds) as a single string.

Example:

- Input: "12:32 34:01 15:23 9:27 55:22 25:56"
- Output: "2:32:41"
